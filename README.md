# AFL-Data-Dashboard
Learning how to use Plotly Dash.

This project is helping me learn how to create a data dashboard.
My goal is to have a nice looking dahsboard that will let me:
  - choose a home team
  - view their home and away scores for a user selected data range
  - show a pie chart of W, D and L
  - show a list of players
  - when the user choses a player, show their stats in a "stat window"
